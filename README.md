# covid19-data-analysis

üìù Project Description
The COVID-19 Data Analysis Project is a data-driven exploration of the global pandemic using real-world data from Our World in Data. This project focuses on understanding trends in COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccination rates by cleaning, processing, and visualizing data for the top 10 most affected countries.

Through this project, you will gain insights into:

Which countries had the highest total cases and deaths

How vaccination efforts evolved over time

The overall trend of the pandemic through time-series plots

The project demonstrates my skills in data cleaning, manipulation using Pandas, and visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn in a Jupyter Notebook.
